# Programming Assignment 2 - QuickSort Count Comparisons

In the second programming assignment we are given [this](https://github.com/rjayswal-pythonista/Algorithms/blob/master/Quicksort_count_comparisons/input.txt) long list of integers and our goal is to sort them using quick sort. More specifically, we should evaluate three different choices for the pivot element of the partition subroutine:

   * Use the first element as the pivot
   * Use the last element
   * Use the median of the three (first-middle-last)

and then calculate the number of comparisons made for each pivot strategy.
