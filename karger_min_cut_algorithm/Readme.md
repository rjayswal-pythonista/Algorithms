# Programming Assignment 3 - Graph minimum cut

In the third programming assignment, we were given [this](https://github.com/rjayswal-pythonista/Algorithms/blob/master/karger_min_cut_algorithm/kargerMinCut.txt) graph and our goal is to comput the [minimum cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_cut). 

I h've learned a super cool algorithm during this week of the course, the [Karger's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm). 
This is a randomized algorithm, meaning that it does not always produce the correct result, but it's superfast, so running the same algorithm many times almost guarantees that we'll get the expected result.
